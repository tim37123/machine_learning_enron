### Task 1: Select what features you'll use.
### features_list is a list of strings, each of which is a feature name.
### The first feature must be "poi".
features_list = ['poi','total_payments', 'from_this_person_to_poi', 'total_stock_value', 'expenses', 'long_term_incentive'] # You will need to use more features

### Load the dictionary containing the dataset
with open("final_project_dataset.pkl", "r") as data_file:
    data_dict = pickle.load(data_file)

### Task 2: Remove outliers
#Kenneth Lay and the bogus "TOTAL" parameter both are outside acceptable range, deleting as outliers
del data_dict['TOTAL']
del data_dict['LAY KENNETH L']

#Track all names that don't have payments info
to_remove = []
for key in data_dict:
	if data_dict[key]['total_payments'] == 'NaN':
		to_remove.append(key)

#delete anyone without payment info
for name in to_remove:
	del data_dict[name]

### Store to my_dataset for easy export below.
my_dataset = data_dict

### Extract features and labels from dataset for local testing
data = featureFormat(my_dataset, features_list, sort_keys = True)
labels, features = targetFeatureSplit(data)

### Task 4: Try a varity of classifiers
### Please name your classifier clf for easy export below.
### Note that if you want to do PCA or other multi-stage operations,
### you'll need to use Pipelines. For more info:
### http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/pipeline.html

# Provided to give you a starting point. Try a variety of classifiers.
from sklearn import tree
clf = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(max_features=5)

### Task 5: Tune your classifier to achieve better than .3 precision and recall 
### using our testing script. Check the tester.py script in the final project
### folder for details on the evaluation method, especially the test_classifier
### function. Because of the small size of the dataset, the script uses
### stratified shuffle split cross validation. For more info: 
### http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cross_validation.StratifiedShuffleSplit.html

# Example starting point. Try investigating other evaluation techniques!
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split
features_train, features_test, labels_train, labels_test = \
    train_test_split(features, labels)

clf.fit(features_train, labels_train)
pred = clf.predict(features_test)

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
print accuracy_score(pred, labels_test)
### Task 6: Dump your classifier, dataset, and features_list so anyone can
### check your results. You do not need to change anything below, but make sure
### that the version of poi_id.py that you submit can be run on its own and
### generates the necessary .pkl files for validating your results.
